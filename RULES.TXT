protocol:
each instruction 1 uint
op is 1 byte with up to 24 bits of argument

rules:
6 columns of 10x20 ops each
program starts on a random position in memory
program has a max of 100 ops
addresses are always referred to relatively
circular memory
program crashes when reading an invalid address

ops:
0x0 - No operation
0x1 - Jump (addr:12b)
0x2 - Write (A => B)
0x3 - Add (B = A + B)
0x4 - Subtract (B = A - B)
0x5 - Skip if equal (A & B)
